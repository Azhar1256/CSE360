Cane for the visually impaired
According to the most recent data census provided by the National Eye Institute, the number of
people with visual impairment in the United States is calculated to double by 2050, which is
estimated to be more than 8 million people. Despite this drastic increase in blindness, there still
seems to be no permanent cure for the visually impaired. In this fast moving world, a constant
guide or human figure support for the blind seems difficult to attain due to people's being busy in
their day to day activities. Considering this, we aim on interfacing a smart cane which will easen
the movement and functionality of the blind, thereby reducing the pressure of a human aid. This
cane will help the visually impaired to attain normality and function on his own to a certain
extent which will eventually increase productivity in that individual. The aim of designing this
cane is in such a way that minimal cost is incurred since losing the blind stick is a common issue
among the weak sighted. The blind cane that we aim at designing interfaces for by collecting
data about the dangers in the surrounding environment and alerting the blind user by producing
sounds from the buzzer. The Adafruit AHT20 takes the surrounding temperature and humidity as
an input, and if the temperature and humidity are above a certain threshold, it signals the user of
the presence of a hot body or high water content within that area. Thus, the blind become aware
and do not take that particular path. Using the GY-NE06MV2, the family of the blind individual
can keep track of his whereabouts as this is a satellite based navigation system. Accordingly, the
A6 GPRS GSM Module will serve as a messenger and notify his location to a family member
through SMS. The HC-SR04 is used to sense obstacles around the blind user, and if an obstacle
is detected, warning signals in the form of sound through the buzzer are sent out to the user. And
from this notification, the blind person is alerted and moves along a different route.
